# clusterPower 0.6.1

- Adding functions for closed-form solutions to normal, count (Poisson), and dichotomous outcomes that mirror power.t.test, etc.  
- Under the hood, documentation is migrated to Roxygen2, and all functions outside of base are explicitly called, via, e.g, stats::.
- Also, Nick Reich graciously transferring maintainership to Ken Kleinman.
