\title{Power calculations for simple cluster randomized trials, count outcome}
\usage{
crtpwr.2rate(alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, nclusters = NA, py = NA,
  r1 = NA, r2 = NA, cvb = NA, r1inc = TRUE,
  tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The level of significance of the test, the probability of a
Type I error.}

\item{power}{The power of the test, 1 minus the probability of a Type II
error.}

\item{nclusters}{The number of clusters per condition. It must be greater than 1.}

\item{py}{The number of person-years of observation per cluster.}

\item{r1}{The expected mean event rate per unit time in the treatment group.}

\item{r2}{The mean event rate per unit time in the control group.}

\item{cvb}{The between-cluster coefficient of variation.}

\item{r1inc}{Logical indicating if r1 is expected to be greater than r2. This is
only important to specify if one of r1 or r2 is NA.}

\item{tol}{Numerical tolerance used in root finding. The default provides
at least four significant digits.}
}
\value{
The computed argument.
}
\description{
Compute the power of a simple cluster randomized trial with a count outcome,
or determine parameters to obtain a target power.

\section{Note}{

  This function was inspired by work from Stephane Champely (pwr.t.test) and
  Peter Dalgaard (power.t.test). As with those functions, 'uniroot' is used to
  solve power equation for unknowns, so you may see
  errors from it, notably about inability to bracket the root when
  invalid arguments are given.

\examples{
# Find the number of clusters per condition needed for a trial with alpha = 0.05, 
# power = 0.80, 10 person-years per cluster, rate in condition 1 of 0.10 
# and condition 2 of 0.20, and cvb = 0.10.
crtpwr.2rate(py=10, r1=0.10, r2=0.20, cvb=0.10)
# 
# The result, showimg nclusters of greater than 24, suggests 25 clusters per
# condition should be used.
