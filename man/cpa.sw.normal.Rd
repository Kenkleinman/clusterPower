\title{Power calculations for stepped wedge cluster randomized trials, continuous outcome}
\usage{
cpa.sw.normal(
  alpha = 0.05,
  power = 0.8,
  nclusters = NA,
  nsubjects = NA,
  ntimes = NA,
  d = NA,
  icc = NA,
  rho_c = NA,
  rho_s = NA,

  tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The level of significance of the test, the probability of a
Type I error.}

\item{power}{The power of the test, 1 minus the probability of a Type II
error.}

\item{nclusters}{The number of clusters switching to the intervention condition at each time point.}

\item{nsubjects}{The number of subjects in each cluster.}

\item{ntimes}{The number of time points in the trial (not including baseline).}

\item{d}{The expected treatment effect.}

\item{icc}{The intra-cluster correlation, the correlation in outcome measurements between
two individuals from the same cluster.}

\item{rho_c}{The cluster autocorrelation, the correlation between two population means
from the same cluster at different times. This value can be used in both cross-sectional and cohort
designs.}

\item{rho_s}{The individual autocorrelation, the correlation between two outcome measurements
in the same individual at different times. In a purely cross-sectional design (new subjects are
obtained at each time point), this value should be 0. For a cohort design (the same subjects are
observed at each time point), this value will be greater than 0.}

\item{vart}{The total variation of the outcome (the sum of variances from cluster and individual
level random effects).}

\item{tol}{Numerical tolerance used in root finding. The default provides
at least four significant digits.}
}
\value{
The computed argument.

\description{
Compute the power of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design with a continuous outcome,
or determine parameters to obtain a target power.

\details{
Exactly one of \code{alpha}, \code{power}, \code{nclusters}, \code{nsubjects},
  \code{ntimes}, \code{d}, \code{icc}, \code{rho_c}, \code{rho_s}, and \code{vart}
  must be passed as \code{NA}. Note that \code{alpha} and\code{power}
  have non-\code{NA} defaults, so if those are the parameters of 
  interest they must be explicitly passed as \code{NA}.

The stepped wedge model assumed by Hooper et al (2016) is given below:

  \deqn{y_{itjk} = \mu + \beta_t + X_{it}\theta + c_{ij} + (ct)_{itj} + s_{ijk}} + e_{itjk}
   
  where \eqn{y_{itjk}} is the outcome for individual \eqn{k} in cluster \eqn{j} of arm \eqn{i}
  at time \eqn{t}. Fixed effects include the overall mean \eqn{\mu} and effects for time \eqn{\beta_t}.
  The vector \eqn{X_{it}} is 1 if arm \eqn{i} at time \eqn{t} is undergoing the intervention, 0
  otherwise. The terms \eqn{c_{ij}}, \eqn{(ct)_{itj}}, \eqn{s_{ijk}}, and \eqn{e_{itjk}} correspond
  to the time invariant cluster random effect, the time-varying cluster random effect,
  the time invariant subject random effect, and the time-varying subject random effect respectively.
  Random effects are assumed to be independent and Normally distributed with mean 0 and variances
  \eqn{\sigma_{C}^2}, \eqn{\sigma_{CT}^2}, \eqn{\sigma_{S}^2}, and \eqn{\sigma_{E}^2}, respectively.
  
The total variance of the outcome \eqn{\sigma^2} is given by
  
  \deqn{\sigma^2 = \sigma_{C}^2 + \sigma_{CT}^2 + \sigma_{S}^2 + \sigma_{E}^2}
  
Let \eqn{\rho}, \eqn{\rho}, and \eqn{\rho} be the intracluster correlation, cluster autocorrelation,
  and subject autocorrelation, respectively. These parameters are given as follows:
  
  \deqn{\rho = \frac{\sigma_{C}^2 + \sigma_{CT}^2}{\sigma_{C}^2 + \sigma_{CT}^2 + \sigma_{S}^2 + \sigma_{E}^2}}
  
  \deqn{\rho_C = \frac{\sigma_{C}^2}{\sigma_{C}^2 + \sigma_{CT}^2}}
  
  \deqn{\rho_S = \frac{\sigma_{S}^2}{\sigma_{S}^2 + \sigma_{E}^2}}
  
When \eqn{\rho_S = 0} the design is considered to be a cross-sectional design, with new individuals 
  observed at each time point. When \eqn{\rho_S > 0} the design is a closed cohort, with repeated measurements
  on the same individuals at each time point.

\section{Note}{

  This function was inspired by work from Stephane Champely (pwr.t.test) and
  Peter Dalgaard (power.t.test). As with those functions, 'uniroot' is used to
  solve power equation for unknowns, so you may see
  errors from it, notably about inability to bracket the root when
  invalid arguments are given.

\examples{
# Find the required number of clusters switching to intervention at each time point for a trial 
# with alpha = 0.05, power = 0.80, nsubjects = 50, ntimes = 5, d = 1.5 units, icc = 0.2,
# rho_c = 0.80, rho_s = 0, and vart = 16 square-units. Note that because rho_s = 0, this is a 
# cross-sectional design.
cpa.sw.normal(nsubjects = 50, ntimes = 5, d = 1.5, icc = 0.2, rho_c = 0.80, rho_s = 0, vart = 16)
# 
# The result, nclusters = 1.288772, suggests 2 clusters switching per time point should be used. This
# means that the total number of clusters in the study is nclusters*ntimes = 2*5 = 10.
