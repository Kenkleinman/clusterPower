\arguments{
\item{nsim}{Number of datasets to simulate; accepts integer (required).}

\item{nsubjects}{Number of subjects per cluster; accepts either a scalar (equal cluster sizes)
or a vector of length \code{nclusters} (user-defined size for each cluster) (required).}

\item{nclusters}{Number of clusters; accepts non-negative integer scalar (required).}

\item{p0}{Expected probability of outcome in arm 1. Accepts scalar between 0 - 1 (required).}

\item{p1}{Expected probability of outcome in arm 2. Accepts scalar between 0 - 1 (required).}

\item{steps}{Number of crossover steps; a baseline step (all clusters in arm 1) is assumed.
Accepts positive scalar (indicating the total number of steps; clusters per step is obtained by
\code{nclusters / steps}) or a vector of non-negative integers corresponding either to the number
of clusters to be crossed over at each time point (e.g c(2,4,4,2); nclusters = 10) or the cumulative
number of clusters crossed over by a given time point (e.g. c(2,4,8,10); nclusters = 10) (required).}

\item{sigma_b_sq}{Between-cluster variance; accepts non-negative numeric scalar (indicating equal
between-cluster variances for both arms) or a vector of length 2 specifying treatment-specific
between-cluster variances (required).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Default = 0.05.}

\item{method}{Analytical method, either Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) or
Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). Accepts c('glmm', 'gee') (required); default = 'glmm'.}

\item{quiet}{When set to FALSE, displays simulation progress and estimated completion time; 
default is FALSE.}

\item{allSimData}{Option to output list of all simulated datasets; default = FALSE.}

\item{poorFitOverride}{Option to override \code{stop()} if more than 25\%
of fits fail to converge; default = FALSE.}

\item{lowPowerOverride}{Option to override \code{stop()} if the power
is less than 0.5 after the first 50 simulations and every ten simulations
thereafter. On function execution stop, the actual power is printed in the
stop message. Default = FALSE. When TRUE, this check is ignored and the
calculated power is returned regardless of value.}

\item{timelimitOverride}{Logical. When FALSE, stops execution if the estimated completion time
is more than 2 minutes. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{optmethod}{Option to fit with a different optimizer method (using the package \code{optimx}). 
Default is 'L-BFGS-B'.}

\item{seed}{Option to set.seed. Default is NULL.}
}

\description{
This set of functions utilize iterative simulations to determine
approximate power for stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trials. Users
can modify a variety of parameters to suit the simulations to their
desired experimental situation.
}
\details{
Runs power simulations for stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trials
with a binary outcome. The stepped wedge trial design is a type of cross-over
design in which clusters change treatments in waves. Initially all the
clusters recieve the same standard treatment, and at the end of the trial all
of the clusters will be recieving the treatment of interest. More than one
cluster can change treatments in a wave, but the order in which clusters
change treatments is randomly determined. The outcome of interest is assessed
in each cluster during each wave.

Users must specify the desired number of simulations, number of subjects per
cluster, number of clusters per arm, expected absolute difference
between arms, within-cluster variance, between-cluster variance,
significance level, analytic method, progress updates, and simulated data
set output may also be specified.

\examples{

# Estimate power for a trial with 3 steps and 12 clusters in arm 1
# (often the standard-of-care or 'control' arm) at the initiation of the study.
# Those clusters have 50 subjects each, with sigma_b_sq = 1.
# We have estimated arm outcome proportions of 0.1 and 0.2 in the first and second arms,
# respectively, and 100 simulated data sets analyzed by the GLMM method. Using seed = 123,
# the resulting power should be 0.8.
