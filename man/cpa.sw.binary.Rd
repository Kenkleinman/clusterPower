are assumed (required).}

across time steps); accepts numeric (required).}

for participants at first time step; accepts numeric (required).}

\value{
The estimated power.

\description{
This function uses a modified Cox method to determine power for stepped
wedge cluster-randomized controlled trials. Users can modify a variety of
parameters to suit their desired experimental situation.
}
\details{
The stepped wedge trial design is a type of cross-over
design in which clusters change treatments in waves. Initially all the
clusters recieve the same standard treatment, and at the end of the trial all
of the clusters will be recieving the treatment of interest. More than one
cluster can change treatments in a wave, but the order in which clusters
change treatments is randomly determined. The outcome of interest is assessed
in each cluster during each wave.

Users must specify the number of subjects per cluster, number of clusters,
the number of time steps, the baseline effect, the expected treatment effect,
expected absolute difference between treatment
arms, ICC, and time effect.

Much of the FORTRAN code for this package was kindly provided by Dr. Zhou.

\examples{

# Estimate power for a trial with 3 steps and 20 clusters in arm 1 (often the 
# standard-of-care or 'control' arm) at the initiation of the study. Those 
# clusters have 90 subjects each, with anticipated change of -0.75 from the 
# beginning to the end of the study. We estimated arm outcome proportions of 
# 0.2 and 0.4 in the first (usually baseline) and second (usually treatment) 
# arms, respectively, and intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.01. 
# The resulting power should be 0.8170374.
