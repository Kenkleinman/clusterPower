<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Power Estimation for Randomized Controlled Trials: clusterPower</h1>
<h4 class="author">Alexandria C. Sakrejda, Jon Moyer, Ken Kleinman</h4>
<h4 class="date">2020-11-03</h4>



<p>The clusterPower package calculates power using analytical and/or simulation approaches for a wide range of cluster-randomized trial designs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Simple two-arm comparison designs</li>
<li>Difference in difference designs</li>
<li>Individually randomized group treatment trials</li>
<li>Stepped wedge designs</li>
<li>Multi-arm trial designs</li>
</ol>
<p>Cluster-randomized trials are a common clinical trial design, often even a required design for study validity. Investigators may choose cluster randomization design for convenience, for practical reasons, or from necessity. In cluster-randomized trials, subjects that are administratively grouped together are all randomized to the same study treatment. For example, all the patients of each clinic involved in a trial may be grouped within the same treatment or control arm. In this case, the clinic “cluster” is randomized to the treatment arm, which determines the treatment group of each participant who attends that clinic.</p>
<p>“Statistical power” is usually defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that some particular alternative hypothesis is true. All trials must have accurate power and sample size calculations for practical, economic, and ethical reasons—it is ethically unjustifiable to randomize more subjects than necessary to yield sufficient power, and equally unjustifiable to expose subjects to the potential for harm in an underpowered trial.</p>
<p>However, for cluster-randomized trials, power calculations are complex, relying on approximations, and/or on more assumptions than simpler designs and closed-form solutions may not exist. Many available routines are crude approximations, and few are available in free software or in webapps for people without highly technical statistical training. This document introduces you to clusterPower’s basic set of tools, and shows you how to implement them with your trial design.</p>
<div id="icc-considerations" class="section level4">
<h4>ICC considerations</h4>
<p>Investigators should proceed cautiously when transferring intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) from previous studies. This statistic, commonly denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, is—in general terms—a metric for assessing the impact of clustering in cluster randomized trials. The ICC represents the proportion of total variability due to cluster-level variability. The equation for the ICC is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{b}^2/(\sigma_{b}^2+\sigma^2)\)</span> for normal outcomes. For other outcome distributions, e.g., for dichotomous outcomes, the definition of ICC may not be clear. Notably, extrapolating sample size or power esimates using the ICC for observed dichotomous outcomes may be particularly fraught (<span class="citation">Eldridge, Ukoumunne, and Carlin (2009)</span> and @<span class="citation">Gatsonis (2017)</span>). For this reasor, we prefer to specificy models using natural parameters such as the variance of the random effects. If you use the ICC for non-normal outcomes, make sure you understand how previous investigators determined their ICC values before applying their statistics in your calculations.</p>

</div>
<div id="outcome-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Outcome types</h3>
<p>This package is focused on calculating effect and sample size-related parameters for cluster randomized trials in which two or more interventions are compared with respect to continuous, binary, or count (Poisson-distributed) outcomes. Incidence rate and time-to-event outcome variables are also potential outcome structures which may influence how effective sample size or cluster number is calculated. See <span class="citation">Gao et al. (2015)</span> for more details on methodological approaches for different outcome types.</p>
</div>
<div id="analytic-vs.-simulation-approaches" class="section level3">
<h3>Analytic vs. simulation approaches</h3>
<p>This package has options to implement either analytic or simulation-based power estimation methods. Analytic solutions to power and sample size relationships exist in certain settings, including cases of equal cluster sizes and normally-distributed outcomes. As an example, for a two-arm study with a normal outcome:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
W=P(t_{d,f,\lambda}&lt;t_{d,f}^{-1}(\frac{\alpha}{2}))+P(t_{df,\lambda}&gt;t_{d,f}^{-1}(\frac{1-\alpha}{2}))
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(df=2(N-1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=d/[2(1+(N-1)\rho))/MN]^{\frac{1}{2}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d=(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})/\sigma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{g}\)</span> is the arm <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> mean, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the number of study participants per cluster, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of clusters in each arm. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(t_{k,\lambda}\)</span> is a variate from the noncentral <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}^{-1}(a)\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>th quantile from the central <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> degrees of freedom. The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is the correlation between two subjects within any cluster, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> in the above equation. In general, as the number of clusters <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> increases, the analytic power approximation becomes more accurate. The approximation worsens slightly as <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> increases and the ICC <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> decreases.</p>
<p>(check definition of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, also shown as “cluster sizes”)</p>
<p>When clusters differ in size or the study outcome is non-normal, power can instead be estimated by simulation. (Approximate analytic results may also exist.) This procedure entails simulating data under the alternative, evaluating whether the null hypothesis was rejected, and repeating. The proportion of rejections observed is an estimate of power. As opposed to the analytic approach shown in the previous paragraph, a basic algorithm for assessing power for a normal outcome across two arms using a <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-fold simulation approach is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sample cluster sizes <span class="math inline">\(M_{i}\)</span></li>
<li>Sample random effects <span class="math inline">\(b_{i}\)</span></li>
<li>For each cluster <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sample, from a normal distribution, residual error <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(Y_{ij}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}I(G_{ij}=1)+...+b_{i}+e_{ij}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Perform data analysis, record whether null hypothesis was rejected.</li>
<li>Repeat previous steps <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Power is estimated by <span class="math inline">\(\sum r_{k}/K\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r_{k}=1\)</span> if the null was rejected in iteration <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. The confidence interval (CI) for the simulated power approximation is calculated based on binomial distribution properties. The approach can be easily modified to accomidate Poisson or dichotomous outcomes, and to adjust for differing cluster sizes, which marks an advantage of resampling methodology over some analytical approaches.</p>

<div id="simple-two-arm-comparison-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Simple two-arm comparison designs</h2>
<p>In a simple two-arm parallel design setting, our random effects model looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
y_{itj}= \beta_{0}+x_{ij}\beta_{1}+b_{i}+e_{ij}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> indicates a cluster, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> indicates a subject within the cluster, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}=1\)</span> if subject <span class="math inline">\(ij\)</span> is in the treatment group and 0 if not. The error term <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span> is assumed to be distributed normal with mean = 0 and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(b_{i}\)</span>, uncorrelated with <span class="math inline">\(e_{ij}\)</span>, is assumed to be normal with mean 0 and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_b^{2}\)</span>. For assessing power by simulation, we determine whether <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_1=0\)</span> is rejected or not.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="difference-in-difference-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Difference in difference designs</h2>
<p>In this design, all clusters are observed in a baseline period, then some clusters are randomized to a treatment. The design accomidates pre-existing differences between the arms and provides increased power. The difference in differences trial can be modeled as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
y_{itj}= \beta_{0}+x_{itj}\beta_{1}+p_{itj}\beta_{2}+x_{itj}p_{itj}\beta_{3}+b_{i}+e_{ij}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> indexes period (baseline or intervention) and <span class="math inline">\(x_{itj}=1\)</span> if cluster <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is in the treatment group and <span class="math inline">\(p_{itj}=1\)</span> if time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is in the intervention period, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. Notably, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{3}\)</span> is the difference in period effect in the treatment group relative to the non-treatment group. For assessing power by simulation, we determine whether <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_3=0\)</span> is rejected or not.</p>
<p>NOTE TO KK– ADD IN THE EXTRA RANDOM EFFECT FOR THE SECOND TIME POINT???</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="individually-randomized-group-treatment-trials" class="section level2">
<h2>Individually randomized group treatment trials</h2>
<p>In the other RCT designs discussed here, nesting of individuals within clusters should be established prior to randomization. However, clustering may also occur when randomization is individual but treatment is administered in groups, or there are effects associated with the clinicians offering treatment, i.e. groups of individuals are treated by the same physician. A two-arm individually randomized group treatment trial can be modeled as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
y_{ij}= \beta_{0}+x_{ij}\beta_{1}+x_{ij}b_{i1}+e_{ij}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>i.e., exactly as the simple two arm trial with different between-cluster variances per arm, except that the between-group variance in one arm may be 0, because there are no groups. <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}\)</span> is included as a treatment indicator. As in the parallel treatment group design, for assessing power by simulation, we determine whether <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_1=0\)</span> is rejected or not.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="stepped-wedge-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Stepped wedge designs</h2>
<p>In an stepped wedge trial, all participants typically receive the intervention. However, participants in the treatment arm begin the intervention in groups at different times, with the intervention continued until the end of the study. The stepped wedge trial design is a type of cross-over trial in which clusters switch treatments in waves. Initially all the clusters recieve the same standard treatment, and at the end of the trial all of the clusters recieve the treatment of interest. More than one cluster can change treatments in a wave, but the order in which clusters change treatments is randomly determined. During each wave, the outcome of interest is assessed for all clusters.</p>
<p>(eqn) <span class="citation">(see Hussey and Hughes 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>JM– Please add equation!! And a statement about how we do simulation!</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="multi-arm-trial-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Multi-arm trial designs</h2>
<p>Frequently investigators need to design trials with three, four, or more arms. For a thourough discussion of the benefits of using mutli-arm approaches, see <span class="citation">Parmar, Carpenter, and Sydes (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">O’Dowd (2014)</span>. Consider the following linear model, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> represents the treatment arm <span class="math inline">\(k=1...k-1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
y^{-1}(\mu_{ij})= \beta_{0}+x_{1ij}\beta_{1}+x_{2ij}\beta_{2}+...x_{(k-1)ij}\beta_{(k-1)}+b_{i}+e_{ij}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(x_{rij}\)</span> is an indicator variable identifying whether subject <span class="math inline">\(ij\)</span> is in treatment group <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> or not. For assessing power by simulation, we determine whether <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_1= \beta_2= \cdots \beta_{k-1}=0\)</span> is rejected or not, and we can also examine individual <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s.</p>
