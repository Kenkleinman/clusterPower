Description: Calculate power for cluster randomized trials (CRTs) that compare two means, two proportions, or two counts using closed-form solutions. In addition, calculate power for cluster randomized  crossover trials using Monte Carlo methods. For more information, see Reich et al. (2012) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035564>.
